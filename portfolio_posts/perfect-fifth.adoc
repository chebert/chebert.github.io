Perfect Fifth is a phone app written to teach beginning musicians about the concepts of tonal harmony.
It is the brainchild of Jazz Saxophonist Lukas Hein with contributions from Christopher Hebert and Aidan O'Malley.
It was developed as part of Oregon State University's Senior Capstone for undergraduates in Computer Science.
