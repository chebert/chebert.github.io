This project demonstrates:

* Understanding and implementation of low-level assembly language
** Understanding of instruction cycles and attention to timings
* Understanding and implementation of hardware based on official documentation
** Understanding of how and when different hardware components interact
* Implementation of a debugger
* Implementation of visualizations of CPU, and graphics data
** Showing state of CPU
* Implementation of a GUI
* "Threading" execution of GameBoy hardware components and execution of real hardware
* Working with a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to interface with graphics libraries

CAUTION: This project is a work in progress. Currently it only implements enough instructions to run the BIOS, which displays and scrolls the Nintendo Logo. It cannot run any games. It does not emulate sound.

== Project Goals
The goal of this project is to implement Original GameBoy Emulator such that:

* the Emulator can emulate some common titles:
** Tetris
** Dr. Mario
** The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
* it runs at full speed (~60 Frames per Second)
* it has a debugger that:
** supports step, breakpoints, continue, and resuming execution
** displays CPU state and how the CPU state has changed
** displays memory updates for each instruction
** displays regions of memory
** displays relevant memory-based registers
* it has visualizations that:
** display background tiles
** display tile maps
** display memory-based registers in relevant ways
* has full sound support
* has a well-organized and well-documented code-base that is easy to follow for anyone familiar with the domain
* is implemented in Lisp
* uses the SDL library, and as few additional libraries as possible


== Project Demonstration

=== Debugger

Pressing step several times results in some history and some some changes to machine.

.Stepping through several instructions

Any of the previous history items can be clicked, and the machine state is restored.

.Clicking on a previous machine state

NOTE: This instruction caused an update to memory, view-able in the "Memory Updates" region.

The Hex (hexadecimal), Bin (binary), and Dec (decimal) radio buttons change the display of numeric values.

.Viewing values as binary numbers

You can click "Dec" to see register values interpreted as signed numbers.

.Viewing values as unsigned and (signed) integers

=== Visualizations

The GameBoy has a Sprite tile map, with tiles 8 pixels by 8 pixels.
The Tile window displays all of the tiles laid out in memory.
A specific tile can be zoomed in on using the number entry box.

.Viewing the 26th tile in the tile map: (R).

The GameBoy has a background tile map layout, which lays out tiles from the Sprite tile map.
The GameBoy renders a portion of this background tile map to the screen.
The portion and position of the screen is represented as a red rectangle in the Tile Map window.

=== GameBoy Screen

The output is displayed in a zoomed-in window.
The Animate/Stop radio button starts or stops the full machine simulation.

Notice how the output of this screen corresponds to window on the background tile map.
