NOTE: I was experimenting with minimizing the number of function calls, so a lot of the code for these projects is "inline".
This resulted in a high level of nesting, and I wouldn't ordinarily do it this way.

Each game is a single C-file which only depends on the NCURSES library.
They can be compiled and run on POSIX systems:

.Example of compiling and running tetris
[source,bash]
----
gcc tetris.c -o tetris -lncurses
./tetris
----

== Tetris

This is a faithful recreation of the NES version of the game Tetris.

.Level 0 of Tetris

.Getting a Tetris causes the screen to flash

.Level 1 of Tetris: colors change and speed increases
image::tetris-colors.png[]

The `z` and `x` keys rotate the tetronimoes. 
The left and right arrow keys move left and right.
Down causes a "soft" drop, and pressing down again stops the "soft" drop.
"Soft" dropping increases the score.

Code for Tetris can be found https://gist.github.com/chebert/0443fa343804fe5cc203d35ddcbd1155[here]

== Freecell

This is a version of Freecell that is optimized for impatient people.
It probably takes the fun out of playing this game.

* the next cards to go to the upper right are highlighted
* the number of cards you can pick up is displayed in the cursor triangle
** empty slots display the number of extra cards you can pick up: +1 for freecells and x2 for the table cells
* the number of "tableau" moves available is displayed
* the cursor only moves to valid positions

Pressing `Enter` reveals more information:

* keyboard controls
* number of moves
* time spent
* number of restarts
* number of undos

It might miss the point of Freecell, but it makes it a lot more fun for me.

The code for freecell can be found https://gist.github.com/chebert/b1dfc09e5bbac0030f96bd689a8ba724[here].

== Pacman

Pacman is a faithful recreation of the classic arcade game, leaning heavily on https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php?print=1[the Pacman Dossier].
I have even implemented pixel-level collision detection, resulting in a bug where you can go through ghosts without dying.

Each Ghost has their own unique behavior, characterized by their chase targets:

* red chases Pacman directly
* pink chases the square a few tiles in front of Pacman
* orange chases Pacman, but then runs away when he gets close.
* blue chases a tile based on pink's location and Pacman's orientation

There are many other minutiae, such as:

* ghosts won't go up through certain corridors, unless they are scared (Pacman has eaten a powerup)
* ghosts have a chase mode and a run to corner mode
* ghosts change speed when going through the off-screen corridor
* many parameters change during level up

.What it looks like to win a level

I also implemented 2 player mode.

Code for this version of Pacman can be found https://gist.github.com/chebert/f71a8694f2815061d705f610329e2a5b[here].
