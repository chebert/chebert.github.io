<p>Perfect Fifth is a phone app written to teach beginning musicians about the concepts of tonal harmony.
It is the brainchild of Jazz Saxophonist Lukas Hein with contributions from Christopher Hebert and Aidan O&#8217;Malley.
It was developed as part of Oregon State University&#8217;s Senior Capstone for undergraduates in Computer Science.</p>
