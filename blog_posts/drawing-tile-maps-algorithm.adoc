== Tile Maps

2D games often use tile maps as part of the background.
Tiles are small (e.g. 32 pixels x 32 pixels) 2d rectangles that are backed by a sprite.
Tiles are loaded as a grid in a single image: a _tilesheet_.

=== How Individual tiles are drawn

Tiles are drawn by drawing a tile-sized portion of the tilesheet onto the window screen.
In SDL:

.Drawing a tile in SDL
[source,c,linenums]
----
#define TILE_SIZE 16
void draw_tile(SDL_Renderer* renderer, SDL_Texture* tile_sheet,
               int tile_x, int tile_y,
               int window_pos_x, int window_pos_y) {
     SDL_Rect src, dest;
     src.x = tile_x * TILE_SIZE;
     src.y = tile_y * TILE_SIZE;
     dest.x = window_pos_x;
     dest.y = window_pos_y;
     src.w = src.h = dest.w = dest.h = TILE_SIZE;
     SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, tex, &src, &dest);
}
----

`tile_x` and `tile_y` refer to the zero-based grid positions.
This code assumes square tiles of fixed size `TILE_SIZE`.

An example call of this algorithm, draws a bush to a black screen:

[source,c,linenums]
----
draw_tile(renderer, tile_sheet, 6, 1, 50, 100);

=== How a tile map is drawn (naïve)

An in game tile map is represented as a grid of tile coordinates (and other tile data).
Given a 2d grid of <tile_x, tile_y> coordinates.

.Naïve Algorithm
. Determine window size and camera position
. Clear the screen
. Render only those tiles which are determined to be on screen
. Render all sprites

==== Source of Slowdown

If you have a large screen size full of tiles, say 100 tiles x 100 tiles, drawing a full tile map would result in about *10000 draw calls per frame*.
The problem is compounded if you are calling out to C code from another language.
If you are using a garbage collected language, and are not careful with your allocations, the problem intensifies.

NOTE: This is not premature optimization.
This constant redrawing can end up taking more than 17ms (a full frame at 60 FPS) resulting in noticeable stuttering.

=== Solution

The main idea is to reduce the number of draw calls by only redrawing tiles when necessary.

.The ideal
All 10000 tiles are only drawn in initialization.
When the camera has scrolled far enough to add new tiles, only the new tiles would be drawn.
If the camera moves slower than one tile per frame, the number for our large screen becomes *at most 100 draw calls per frame*.

To accomplish this, we can create a texture as a render target.
The texture should be the size of the screen plus a tile-sized "ring".

.Updated Algorithm
* The initial background tiles are drawn to the render target
** include a ring of "unseen" tiles
* Render the background as repeating
** this can take 1 to 4 draw calls
* Whenever the camera moves, draw new tiles if they need to be drawn

This results in at least 1 draw call and at most 100 tile + 4 background draw calls per frame.

== Reflection

* this technique could be used for flipping between multiple tile maps quickly (if many tiles are animated)
* to have empty tiles, you can have a transparent channel or key color
** to destroy tiles, you can draw over the old tiles with the key color
* the GameBoy uses a buffer like this
