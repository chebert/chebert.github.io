== What is a web framework supposed to do?

.AngularJS: makes HTML pages dynamic
* display dynamic lists
* one way data-binding: read only lists
* two-way data-binding: editable fields
* routing for navigating among different views and their components
* declarative; data-driven
* works with plain HTML

.ReactJS: makes creating interactive components easy
* JSX allows creating HTML with JavaScript embedded
* one-way data-binding: sending props to children
* reacting to input: register event handler and call this.setState()
* automatically re-render when changes occur

.So, a web framework should:
* render HTML from variables/functions/database
* render different views of the same information without duplicating
* not directly mutate any data
* work with plain HTML
* re-render HTML when dependent information changes (binding)

== Solving the problems

=== Render HTML from Variables

This is _easy_.
As I showed in link:blog_post.html?title=A%20Superior%20Web%20Framework%20for%20Those%20Who%20Don%27t%20Much%20Care%20for%20Web%20Development[part 1], all you need are a couple of functions to make this work.

=== Render different views of the same information without duplicating

Again, this is _easy_.
Given some data, all you need to do is come up with functions which parse this data and render HTML elements.

=== Not Directly Mutate any Data

I don't see any reason why you _need_ to.

=== Work with HTML

HTML can be loaded in using an XMLHTTPRequest.
Using templates is trickier.

=== Two-way binding Model and UI

This is the meatiest problem that web frameworks solve.
But still not that complicated.

* set up an event handler for when the data changes
** when the data changes, update all views that reference this data

You can either:

* manually keep track of which views reference this data
** easy, but not easily scaleable
* automatically keep track of what model data views are dependent on
