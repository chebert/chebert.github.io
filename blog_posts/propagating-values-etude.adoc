Short study on using an event system to propagate value changes through a system.

* spreadsheet style computations
* binding UI elements to changing values

Generally, things that should only be recomputed when a value it depends on changes.

== How it works

Suppose you have an event system:

. give interesting values unique identifiers
. whenever an interesting value changes, create an event specifying the id and new value
. dependent values can then handle this event
