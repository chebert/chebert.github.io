== What are scripted sequences?

Scripted sequences are very useful for telling stories and guiding interactions between entities.
They are like theater scripts: they tell entities what to do and when to do it.

== Example

.Secret of Monkey Island: from http://ohbabyitslucasarts.tumblr.com/post/87619859708/1hp-1mp-monkey-island-melee-island[ohbabyitslucasarts]

. Otis: says "You gotta get me outta here" while looking back and forth
. Otis: says "I'm a victim of society" while looking back and forth
. Guybrush: looks at camera
. Guybrush: says "Not to mention halitosis"
. Guybrush: walks to stage center
. Guybrush: says "Yuck!"

== What I need from a scripted sequence system

.Scripted Sequences
* scripted sequences can deliver messages/commands/events
* scripted sequences can wait for and receive events
** when a character has finished talking or walking, they can send the next event

.Scripted Sequence System
* the system should support adding and removing scripts
* the system should support multiple scripts at once
* the system should receive events and forward them to scripts
* the system should update all active scripts

=== How to implement waiting?

The only scripts that need to receive events are the ones that are waiting to receive events.
These waiting scripts can be kept separate from the active scripts.

== What I came up with

(defun script-wait-for-event (event) (cons :wait event))
(defun script-send-event (event) (cons :send event))

(defstruct script-system
  active-scripts
  waiting-scripts)

(defun update-script-system (script-system)
  (let ((waiting (script-system-waiting-scripts script-system)))
    (dolist (script (script-system-active-scripts script-system))
      (loop for script2 on script do
	   (let* ((stmt (first script 2))
		  (type (car stmt))
		  (event (cdr stmt)))
	     (ecase type
	       (:wait (push script2 waiting)
		      (return))
	       (:send (push-event! event))))))
    (make-script-system :active-scripts () :waiting-scripts waiting)))

(list
 (script-send-event (event-say :otis "You gotta get me out of here."))
 (script-send-event (event-look-back-and-forth :otis))
 (script-wait-for-event (event-finished-talking :otis))

 (script-send-event (event-say :otis "I'm a victim of society"))
 (script-send-event (event-look-back-and-forth :otis))
 (script-wait-for-event (event-finished-talking :otis))

 (script-send-event (event-look-forward :otis))
 (script-send-event (event-look-at-camera :guybrush))
 (script-send-event (event-say :guybrush "Not to mention halitosis"))
 (script-send-event (event-walk-to-stage-center :guybrush))
 (script-wait-for-event (event-walk-to-stage-center :guybrush)))
