== Why would we want a timer system?

image:hourglass.png[width=25%,float="right"]

Timers are countdowns: counting down from a given amount of time and issuing an alarm when the time has elapsed.
Timer systems synchronize entities.
The logic behind timers is simple, but can easily clutter up the logic of an entities behavior and their state.
Putting this logic in a timer system does a lot to decrease complexity of entities.

=== What do I want from a timer system?

.Without a timer system:
* An entity starts keeping track of time elapsed when it wants to start a timer
* The entity continually checks to see if elapsed time exceeds a specified time
* When the time has elapsed, the entity changes its behavior and stops keeping track of time

.With a timer system:
* An entity adds a timer to the timer system, saying it wants to change behavior in a certain amount of time
* The timer system sends a message to the entity, when the time has elapsed

With a timer system, the entity does not keep track of elapsed time, and does not continually check for time elapsed.
This makes adding timers trivial and fluid.

== An Event-based Implementation

Assuming an event queue with `(event-push! event)` defined:

[source,lisp,linenums]
----
(defvar *countdowns*)
(defun countdown-push! (countdown)
  (push *countdowns* countdown))

(defstruct countdown
  remaining-ticks
  event)
----

Entities can specify the message/event they want to have delivered with the `event` field of the `countdown` structure.

Here `\*countdowns*` is a stack, treated like a FIFO.
Timers are updated in reverse order for chronological consistency:

[source,lisp,linenums]
----
(defun update-countdowns (countdowns)
  ;; Save still-active countdowns into new-countdowns
  (let ((new-countdowns ()))
    ;; Iterate over all countdowns
    (dolist (countdown (reverse countdowns))
      ;; Time elapses...
      (let ((remaining-ticks (- (countdown-remaining-ticks countdown) 1))
            (event (countdown-event countdown)))
        ;; has the countdown expired?
        (if (zerop remaining-ticks)
            ;; if the countdown expired, push the event and
            ;; remove the countdown from the list
            (event-push! event)
            ;; if the countdown is still active, update the old countdown and
            ;; keep it on the list
            (push (make-countdown :remaining-ticks remaining-ticks
                                  :event event)
                  new-countdowns))))
    (nreverse new-countdowns)))
----

Remaining ticks is decremented by 1 each update; timers are synced with the update cycle.
When the timer expires, the event is added to the event queue and removed from the timer system.

== A trivial example

Suppose we have a piano-playing entity:

[source,lisp,linenums]
----
(defun piano-player-update (player)
  (case (piano-player-state player)
    (:first-note
     (countown-push! (make-countdown :remaining-ticks 10
                                     :event :change-note-event))
     (play-first-note player))
    (:second-note
     (countown-push! (make-countdown :remaining-ticks 20
                                     :event :change-note-event))
     (play-second-note player))
    (:third-note
     (countown-push! (make-countdown :remaining-ticks 5
                                     :event :change-note-event))
     (play-third-note player))
    (t player)))

(defun piano-player-handle-event (player event)
  (case event
    (:change-note-event (player-change-state-to-next-note player))
    (t player)))
----

Our piano player will play the first note for 10 ticks, the second note for 20, and the third note for 5.
The player only keeps track of what note it's playing.

== Reflection

* Remaining-ticks could be synced up with real time or some other time instead of the update cycle
* A function like `(countdown-cancel! event)` could remove countdowns with events that match `event`
* Implementing commands for the timer system is trivial
** Create a `countdowns-handle-event` function which handles an `event-countdown-created` event
* Adding the timer expiration to the event queue means that every entity can be notified of what happened.
* Repeating timers could be implemented by adding a `num-repeats` field to the `countdown` structure
